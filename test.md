# Govern create

This package contains the factory contracts:
* `GovernFactory`
* `GovernQueueFactory`
* `GovernBaseFactory`

# Configuration

First, run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.

Then, create the `.env` file in the root directory of this package and include those:
* `ETHERSCAN_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`
* `MNEMONIC_RINKEBY=MNEMONIC_FOR_RINKEBY`
* `MNEMONIC_MAINNET=MNEMONIC_FOR_MAINNET`

If you don't want to verify contracts on etherscan right away after deploying the contracts, you can omit `ETHERSCAN_KEY` from the `.env` config.

# Deployment

After the configuration step is done, you can run `yarn deploy`.
